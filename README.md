# Cryptography-Project-for-Secure-Communication
B.tech Final Year College Project for Secure Message Communication though Cryptography Algorithm 

![maxresdefault](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28294942/108817602-25a9b300-75de-11eb-9e44-52aee480a797.jpg)

Communication mad secure by using 3 Layers of Different complex Ciphers.

Triple Layering of message for security are as follows-

Step 1: Messgae will be **reverse.**

Step 2: Resultant reverse Output will go through **vigenere cipher**

Step 3: The New resultant output from vigenere cipher will be encrypted through **Morse cipher.**

Step 4: The Output will be **very complex and unreadable.**


I have explain point to point in Description(Report) 

I will send you- 
- Project Code
- Project report
- Project Synopsis 
- Project Research papers

This Project is based on Research papers:

This Project is new and Unique.

Python Programming is used for developing this Project.

Thank you.
